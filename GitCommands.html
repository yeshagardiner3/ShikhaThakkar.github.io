## Git Commands

- _git init_ - automatically initialize an empty repo in an existing directory with no server or daemon running in the background. Uses the FS to create a top level directory and a nested folder beneath it called .git.

- _git add_ - Begin tracking a new file. This command indicates that we want the file to participate in the next transaction change set. Is just a suggestion, and not yet a permanent record of that file. Takes either a file name or directory. If directory, will add all of the files in that directory recursively. Multi-purpose command. Can be used to track new files, stage files, and mark merge-conflicted files as resolved. "Add this content to the next commit." Also remember: git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the git add command.

- _git commit -m 'commit message'_ - commit those files. Is now a permanent part of version control.

- _git commit -v_ - puts a diff of the changes in the editor so you can see what changes you are exactly committing.

- _git commit -a_ - Allows the user to skip the staging area by  automatically staging every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip _git add_.

- _git clone [url] < new directory name >_ - get a copy of an existing Git repository

- _git status_ - Get status of the directory. Since Git tracks content, this command examines the current working directory and all of the directories beneath it to see if any of the files have been modified or if it sees any files that weren't there before.

- _git status -s_ - Get short status of directory. Left hand column = staged. Right hand column - modified. New files that aren't tracked = ??

- _git remove -v_ - see remote URL

- _git remote set-url origin [url]_ - change remote URL (ex from SSH to HTTPS)

- _git branch_ - command for toggling to a branch

- _git checkout_ - switches the entire contents of the local directory to be and have the state of the new branch.

- _git diff - What have you changed, but not yet staged? What have you staged that are about to commit? Git diff shows exact lines that were added and removed. Only shows changes that are still unstaged.

- _git diff --staged_ - Shows your staged changes to your last commit.

- _git diff --cached_ - See what you have staged so far.

_git rm_ - Remove a file from Git by removing it from your tracked files (staging area). Then have to commit. Will no longer see the file and it will no longer be tracked.
